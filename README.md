# levelled-piece-chess-variant
chess but every piece has a strength level

In regular chess the attacking piece can kill any other piece in a given area. But in this variant the attacking piece and attacked piece have strength levels. If the strength level of attacked piece is more, then the attacking piece dies. Different chess pieces have different max strength but same minimum strength. For example for pawn piece , strength level can range between 1 to 10 , for rook it can range between 1 to 70. Strength level is randomly assigned to pieces at the initialization of program.
